title: Getting Involved
---

Hi awesome human 👋. You made it to the page about how to get involved 🥰.
Here are a few things where we'd appreciate any input, thoughts or help:

## Baseline Application

You can find the open source Baseline Application [on GitHub](https://github.com/baseline-dev/desktop-client).
If you happen to run into any problems, we welcome any issues you open in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/baseline-dev/desktop-client/issues).

## Baseline Docs

Docs make or break a product. They can be a delightful experience or can be painful.
We would love the Baseline Docs to be delightful. 
So if you find any issues or have feedback, please open an issue in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/baseline-dev/docs/issues). 

## Spread the love
It is surprising again and again how often we don't have a good picture of who in our teams has access to what.
If you ever run into a company, person or team, or anyone really who you think could benefit from Baseline, please let them know 🙏.
