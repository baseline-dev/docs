## Installation

You can run the Baseline CLI by simply double-clicking on the file. 
When you do this for the first time, MacOS will show you a warning, similar to the one below:

<img src="/assets/docs/install-can-not-open.jpg" width="415" alt="Can not open Baseline CLI.">

Here you just have to click "Ok" and acknowledge the message. 
Next, head over to System Preferences and open the Security & Privacy section.
You will see a little note at the bottom mentioning "baseline-macos was blocked".
Press the "Open Anyway" button to confirm that you'd like to run the Baseline CLI. See the picture below:

After this, you will get a final confirmation asking whether you want to open the Baseline CLI.  
Click "Open" and the CLI will open ðŸŽ‰

## Requesting the access token

When you run the Baseline CLI for the first time, you are asked to provide "credentials".
After you have requested access to Baseline, we will reach out to you and provide you with these credentials.
Paste the credential into the prompt.

## Running the CLI

You can start the CLI by `double-clicking on the file` or by `opening a terminal` and then running 

```shell
./baseline-macos
```

## Troubleshooting

Sometimes it can happen that the Baseline CLI will return an error. 
If this persists, you can delete all credentials and local settings by running the `clean` command:
