title: Getting Started with Baseline

Welcome to Baseline ðŸŽ‰ We're really happy that you made it to the documentation pages of Baseline. 
If you ever run into any issues which are not addressed by the docs, please reach out to us [support@baseline.dev](mailto:support@baseline.dev).  

## How do I get access to Baseline?

**Short answer:** 
Head to http://baseline.dev and request an invite.

**Longer answer:** 
We decided to make Baseline invite only for now. 
We do this because we want you to have a delightful experience when you try out Baseline for the first time.
This means that we aim to cover each and every external service you are using. This takes a bit of time. 
When you request an invite, we ask you to share the services which you are using. 
There is a high chance that we already support your needs, and if so, we'll send you an invite right away.
If not, we will prioritize the missing integrations and let you know once they have launched.
Eventually, once we support a big party of services used by you, we will open Baseline to everybody.
In any case, head over to http://baseline.dev and request an invite :)
