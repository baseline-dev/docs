title: Getting Started with Baseline

Welcome to Baseline! We're super happy that you found these pages, so we can help you get started.

## How do I get access to Baseline?

**Short answer:** 
Head to [http://baseline.dev] and request an invite.

**Longer answer:** 
We decided to make Baseline invite only for now. 
We do this because we are running the Baseline business in a peculiar way: We don't believe in bombarding you with email campaigns, tracking your behaviour and secretly selling your data to other companies.
Instead, we want to build long-lasting relationships, with you! We think that we can only do this, if Baseline provides real value to you.
And to provide real value to you, we work with you and make sure that your needs are covered.
Eventually, Baseline will become open to everybody.

## Getting started with the Baseline CLI

First, head to https://baseline.dev/download and download the Baseline CLI. 
Currently we support OSX. After downloading the CLI, unzip the file.

## Requesting the access token

After you have requested access to Baseline, we will reach out to you and provide you with an access token.
Launch the CLI and past the access token when the CLI asks you for it. You are now ready to go.
