Are you using HubSpot to communicate with your customers?
With the Baseline for HubSpot integration you can easily review who has access to your HubSpot account.

## Setting up HubSpot for Baseline

Setting up HubSpot for Baseline is super simple. Once you have kicked off a new Baseline audit, you can simply click on the HubSpot card on the services selection page.
You need to be admin if you want to be able to baseline your HubSpot account.

## Required OAuth permissions

Baseline relies on the following permissions to audit your HubSpot account.
Please not that we require the `contacts` scope since this allows us to query for `owners`.

| OAuth Scope |
|-------------|
| OAuth       |
| Contacts    |
