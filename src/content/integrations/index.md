## Integration roadmap

These services support access of their organizational resources through an API.
This means that integrating with them in an automated fashion is possible.

These services DO NOT! support access of their organizational resources through an API.
This means that we can not fully automate the integration. 
We think it is pretty remarkable that these companies do not allow you to manage your access levels through an API.
Maybe you can reach out to them and ask for broader support for this. Your data is your data in the end.
