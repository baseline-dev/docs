Are you using Slack in your team? 
With the Baseline for Slack integration you can easily review who has access to your Slack workspace.

## Setting up Slack for Baseline

Setting up Slack for Baseline is super simple. Once you have kicked off a new Baseline audit, you can simply click on the Slack card on the services selection page. 
You need to be workspace admin if you want to be able to baseline your Slack workspace.

## Required OAuth permissions

Baseline relies on the following permissions to audit your Slac account:

| OAuth Scope      |

| users:read       |
| users:read.email |       
| team:read        |
